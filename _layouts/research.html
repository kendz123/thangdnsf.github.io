        <div class="executive-summary" style="font-size:17px;">
          <p>My research interest is primarily text mining, information retrieval system, mathematical optimization. I am currently working on a faceted entity ontology learning, gene-based information retrieval system, and relational pattern mining. 
          	 My previous researches were mainly about topic modeling, community detection, and learning to rank.

          Scientific articles are not born equal. Some generate an entire discipline while others make relatively fewer contributions. We studied the problem of identifying those important articles and understanding how they influence others.

		  <p class="resume-item-copy"> The main contributions of this work include:</p>
		  
		  <ul class="resume-item-list">
            <li>Established the Interest aggregation state transition framework in Named Data Networking.</li>
            <li>Proposed Exponential Interest Aggregation (EIA), an adaptive forwarding strategy addressing NDN congestion control problem in a hop-by-hop manner.</li>
            <li>Analyzed the effectiveness of EIA algorithm mathematically under the Interest aggregation state transition framework.</li>
			<li>Conducted simulation to evaluate the performance of EIA and showed that EIA improves average delay by 13%, average number of retransmission by 25%, and cache hit ratio by 61%.</li>
