Hi! My name is Thang Nguyen. I've graduated with a computer science degree from Thang Long University. Currently, I am a Lecturer in Computer Science, department of Mathematics & Informatics at Thang Long University, working on the IOTlab and CSlab. I absolutely love teaching and inspiring students and have been doing so long before my professional experience. My research interests are broadly in Computer science, data science and AI. Other interests include Internet of Things and cryptography.
